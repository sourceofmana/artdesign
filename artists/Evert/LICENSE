Based on the frog man from Redshrike's tower defence prototype (https://opengameart.org/content/tower-defense-prototyping-assets-4-monst...).

The sideways attack and hopping frames are Redshrike's unmodified originals, the north and south frames and death animation are my own adaptations based on his work.
I plan to add a version without the trident and with an attack where he opens his mouth and attacks with his tongue, but that's a little more work.

Should work ok with LPC assets, although the palette does not match the LPC assets. I tried recolouring it, but none of the green ramps in the LPC palette work with this guy. Suggestions for that are welcome.

CHANGES:
* Added a variation with a crown by Stephen Challener (Redshrike)
* Used Puffolotti's alternate animation for the legs.
