# Concepts

## Respawn

When a player collapses, they are respawned at the last Soul Menhir they touched. These ancient monoliths are carved from Zielite, a rare mineral capable of channeling Mana. By linking their inner Mana to a Menhir, players create a bond that allows their spirit to return upon death.

## Zielite Amulets

Zielite Amulets are essential items that allow the wearer to both use Magic and respawn at Soul Menhirs. Every player starts the game with one, and while they can upgrade or exchange it, they can never be without it. The Amulet is the key to avoiding death — a gift few in the world of Aemil possess.

Amulets come in increasing rarities, each offering improved magical properties:
Brass → Silver → Gold → Platinum Zielite Amulets

## Overworld

A player can access the overworld at the end of the tutorial, he can then access rapidly any previously accessed location from an overworld map that will act like a fast-travel system.
