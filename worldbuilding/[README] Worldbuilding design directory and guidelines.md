# Design directory & guidelines

## Disclaimers and Guidance

These documents are disseminated through optional avenues like extra dialogue options, books and optional NPCs that add context and immersion without requiring players to learn and understand everything.

NPCs are not overly detailed about lore or backstory, but only give a sense of their surroundings (with the exception of a small number of key NPCs).
- These key NPCs provide longer stories only as optional dialogue and should not force the player through a complex lore-dive if they don't desire one.
- All background lore helps create a more lively and intriguing world and gives players the option to discover more about their surroundings. Not presenting these elements at all would result in a world that feels incomplete.

Lore-related names can get confusing, so the majority of lore elements will have a plain name alternative (example: Hakuturi = Mana Tree; Poi = Mana Seed). These unique names exist purely for flavour and can be used in NPC dialogues. The key names that players will need to be familiar with are simply "Mana" and "Kaore".

## [Lore](Lore.md)

Explains the key concepts of our world, including the origins and behavior of Mana and Kaore, the significance of Zielite and Soul Menhirs, the nature of Mana Trees and Mana Seeds, and the balance between life and decay.

## Timeline

The world’s history is divided into four broad eras.
- [1st Era, The Hantu Era](Timeline - First Era.md), Aemil is born from Mana and chaos. The Hantu live in harmony with Mana Trees, creating a peaceful, magical world—until the Tritans' misuse of Mana spreads Kaore, ending the golden age in catastrophe.
- [2nd Era, The Ancean Era](Timeline - Second Era.md), new species like Humans and Ukar rise from the ashes. Civilization begins with early cities and kingdoms, as Mana subtly shapes culture and conflict across a changing world.
- [3rd Era, The Era of Conflict](Timeline - Third Era.md), magic becomes a weapon. Wars erupt over Mana and relics, and ancient powers return. Kaore spreads further, fracturing balance and plunging the world into widespread strife.
- [4th Era, The Present Age](Timeline - Fourth Era.md), this is where the story unfolds. Aemil is in a state of rediscovery, with nations rebuilding and adventurers seeking forgotten knowledge. Players take part in shaping the fate of Aemil, with the power to restore balance.

This section helps writers and designers anchor quests and stories within the world's timeline.
 
## [Backstory](Backstory.md)

Explains the history of Mana, its decline after the Aethyra War, and the subsequent fear and restriction of Mana use.

## [Prologue](Prologue.md)

Introduction and first few minutes and quests from a new player perspective.

## Chapters

Our future title updates will be structured as Chapters, with each one introducing a new region, beginning with first Chapter introducing Tulimshar and the Tonori Desert.
Each Chapter will expand the main questline, introduce new side quests, and offer fresh gameplay elements to enrich the world.

As the story unfolds, new Chapters will also introduce standalone main quest arcs, offering players entirely new adventures that run alongside the original main storyline.

## [World](World.md)

This section defines the geography and structure of the game's world. It catalogs the major cities, settlements, islands, and notable landmarks that shape the player's journey.

From the bustling city-states and contested trade routes to forgotten ruins and mystical strongholds, these are the places players will hear about, visit, and explore as they progress through the story.

## [Concepts](Concepts.md)

Our various specific concepts are listed in this file, from bound items to global world design choices.
