# Second Era: Ancean Era, 2000 years span

## Founding of Keshlam and Mangarron (2E1-2E200)

Legend says that the first Human city and the first Ukar city are founded on the same day. Their day of founding marks the first year of the Second Era.
Ever since their arrival on Ancea, Humans and Ukar live a nomadic lifestyle and take what the land has to give. For hundreds of years, semi-permanent camps exist throughout Ancea, but the young evolving races prefer to never settle in one place for too long.
After having lived apart for over 1,000 years, the two races evolve very differently and are now fully distinct from each other and the original Tritans. At this stage, both races begin to grow closer communal ties, and their two largest camps become permanent cities and places of gathering. These eventually become the Human castle and town of Keshlam and the Ukar mountain fortress of Mangarron.

## Age of the Platinum Kingdom (2E201-2E1264)

Hailing from the higher ranks of the City of Keshlam, the young Victorio inherits the family lands north of the city. The site is recently discovered as a rich source of Platinum Ore, and Victorio becomes very wealthy as a result. In 2E201, the old Chief of Keshlam dies and a customary election is held. Such is the popularity and influence of Victorio that he is proclaimed the first King of Humans. He names his domain the Platinum Kingdom, and himself the Platinum King.

The Platinum Kingdom eventually receives the fealty of all Human communities on Ancea. The Ukar continue to live in separate independent settlements carved deep into the Tempus Mountains. Both populations remain small and naturally self-contained, lacking a desire for expansion as part of their nature.

## First Mana Storm (2E1470-2E1480)

A mysterious increase in Mana flow over Aemil causes all nature to grow at an accelerated rate. Records from this period are extremely unusual, with descriptions of bizarre feats of magic, erratic behaviour, illogical stories, and a general sense of whimsy and madness.
The sentient races become unusually proliferous and begin to desire new settlements and different lifestyles. The current Platinum King, Victorio VII, is inspired to expand his kingdom and found new cities.

It is believed by Ukar scholars that the First Mana Storm causes the sentient races of Aemil to develop ambition and desire for power.

### Founding of Hurnscald (2E1477)

The Platinum Kingdom expands eastwards, constructing a walled timber fortress containing its town named Hurnscald. The town starts out as a garrison and a port to the Aemilian Sea, but soon rich minerals are discovered in the mountains nearby, and mining becomes a great industry in this area.

### Founding of Tulimshar (2E1489)

The vast grasslands of Tonori are inhabited by the nomadic Zuni tribes, the earliest Humans to evolve on Ancea. Their rich culture and unique goods encourage the Platinum Kingdom to grow closer ties. A hospitable patch of coastline is selected to found a colony, which is named Tulimshar. The colony receives a significant investment in its early years and quickly grows into a successful trading centre.

### Founding of Nivalis (2E1496)

The cold north is sparsely populated by Human and Ukar alike, who live in small nomadic tribes known as Barbarians. The expansionist King Victorio VII launches an expedition and finds an elevated plateau, near the mountain passes that lead into Kaizei but also close enough to the Aemilian Sea. Here he founds the City of Nivalis—a refuge from the cold and a centre of trade for the whole region.

### Birth of the Kralogs (2E1500)

The Ukar begin to notice that the mountains they inhabit do not cover as much land as the areas where the Humans live. A group of adventurous Ukar set forth in the early decades of the Ancean Era to find new lands to settle. They navigate the cold seas of the north and land on a volcanic island, which they name the Land of Fire. The climate of the island is far from ideal, and the settlers are tested to their extreme, but they survive and more generations are born. Over time, they adapt to the temperature extremes and harsh living conditions of the Land of Fire and become the resilient race now known as Kralogs.

### Founding of Candor (2E1551)

The island of Candor has been used as an outpost for a long time, but it is considered too far away and dangerous to settle. This changes with the rise of Hurnscald on the nearby coast, and a small outpost is established on the island, connected to Hurnscald, Tulimshar, and Nivalis. The island's mysterious cave system, thought to be warped and shaped by an unusual flow of Mana, begins to be used by the Platinum King as an arena to host yearly war games.

## Reign of Queen Platyna the Red (2E1199–2E1265)

Queen Platyna XII, the Red Queen, is the last monarch of the Platinum Kingdom. During her reign, she severely limits the power of her advisors and insists on directly controlling her kingdom, despite the fact that she rarely makes time for it. She is ultimately more interested in keeping her gardens. Due to her unwillingness to cooperate with her council, the kingdom's economy begins to crumble. After 40 years of mismanagement, the now older Red Queen is despised by all her subjects. Over the years, she grows spiteful and sadistic, ordering public executions for petty crimes and demanding ever higher taxes.

### The Blue Revolution (2E1265)

Tired of the Queen's neglect for her people, the council decides to seize power and depose her. On a spring day, during one of the Queen's long absences from court, Chancellor Benjamin Frost convinces the entire council to support an immediate takeover. He proclaims the Republic of Ancea and appoints himself Lord Prince of the Republic. This event becomes known as the Blue Revolution—taking its name from the uniform colours of the Chancellor—and marks the end of the Platinum Kingdom. Frost maintains his title for eighteen months and is eventually deposed by the very council that supported him during the Revolution. Rather than naming a successor, the council names itself the Senate of Ancea, the collective ruler of the Republic.

## Age of the Republic of Ancea (2E1265–2E1984)

The Republic is the first to bring democracy to Aemil. It re-unites the city-states of Keshlam, Hurnscald, Tulimshar, and Nivalis into one nation where all citizens participate in decision-making. Mangarron joins the Republic as well, with the Ukar hoping to build closer ties to the Humans now that their kingdom is no more. Over time, the system grows increasingly bureaucratic, but it endures successfully for over 700 years, marking a mostly prosperous and happy period in the history of Ancea.

### End of the Republic (2E1984)

In its later years, the Republic grows increasingly corrupt. Political factions begin to seek the destruction of their rivals, and wealthy citizens influence most decisions. The four cities of the Republic become increasingly distrusting of each other. In 2E1979, the city of Hurnscald declares its independence along with its historic surrounding territory. Within just a few weeks, Nivalis and then Tulimshar also declare themselves independent. Alone in the Republic, the rulers of Keshlam and Mangarron eventually proclaim its dissolution and thus bring an end to the union of the five cities.

### The Great Quake (2E1996)

The chaste of Sorcerers that rule Tulimshar at this time attempt to find what they believe to be the inner source of Mana inside the world of Aemil. They devise powerful magic constructs powered with Mana Crystals to dig deep into the earth. At an unknown depth, something is triggered. Two-thirds of the vast ocean previously dividing the continents of Ancea and Aurora sink inward into the core of the world. Much of the Tritan civilisation is instantly extinguished, with the exception of those on the Oranye Isles and a few sheltered bays. The Aemilian Sea becomes a smaller body of water almost fully surrounded by the two continents of Ancea and Aurora.

## Age of Exploration (2E1996–2E2100)

Navigators find new lands to the East. The faraway Oranye Isles and distant Aurora seem to have moved closer, creating a calmer sea with shorter distances to cover. A renewed spirit of adventure inspires the people of Ancea. Adventurers, as well as refugees from the revolutionary war, are given ships and organised by the City-States into expedition parties and sent to explore the untamed lands across the Aemilian Sea. The Fleet of Aurora is the largest expedition and becomes the most well-known.

### Discovery of Ker Ys (2E1999)

The City of Ker Ys has existed since the Hantu Era and continues to be the largest underwater city on Aemil. Nested in the low-lying Oranye Isles, it stands mostly submerged and densely populated. Following the Great Quake, the vast landscape of Tritan settlements in the far sea is largely lost, and the Oranye Isles stand as the main Tritan homeland. Once far in the middle of the Ocean, the Isles move closer to other lands as the continents shift, and Ker Ys begins to receive its first visitors.
