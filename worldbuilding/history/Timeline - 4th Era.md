# Fourth Era: Present

## Kaore Storm (4E1)

The high concentration of Kaore grows ever stronger as it feeds on the death and destruction that it creates. Eventually, it can no longer grow due to the strong Mana presence on Aemil, and it implodes, causing an event known as the Kaore Storm. It lasts only a few days (unlike Mana Storms, which last some years) and causes every living creature to fall into a deep sleep. During this time, most people are unharmed. Once the storm is over, there seems to be no detectable presence of Kaore anywhere. Mana is also entirely absent.

## Second Age of Mana (4E1â€“Present)

As Mana slowly returns to Aemil, its ability to fill the world as it once did is impaired. The Hakuturi no longer connect the world, and Kaore threatens to return as the leading force of magic.

### The Hakuturi Speak Again (4E27)

Our journey starts here, Hakuturi has spoken to you and your decision will shape the future of Aemil.
