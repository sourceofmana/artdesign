# Prologue

## Prelude

You lost your way in the desert and don’t remember much of what happened. You know you felt something calling out to you, but in the end, the desert’s heat overcame you.

You collapsed, alone, with nothing but the endless sands around you.

You are now in the City of Tulimshar, Kingdom of Tonori. Recently there have been vicious attacks from creatures coming from the sands of the Tonori Desert. These creatures once dwelled in the desert in harmony, but a force known as Kaore has caused them to either degrade or mutate, becoming dangerous undead or mutant aberrations.

## A New Beginning

You awaken beneath the shade of a palm tree, an empty bowl resting at your side. You wonder if you might have passed out from the heat of the desert...

You know where you are. The famous city of Tulimshar in the Tonori Desert. The scorching heat of the sun irradiates its great sandstone walls.

A young woman with green hair and a bright pink dress kneels beside you, offering a warm smile. Her name is Elanore, the town healer known for rescuing those the desert tries to swallow. Thanks to her, you have been given a second chance.

Nearby, a large stone stands firmly planted into the ground. Its dark irridescent grey colour contrasts with the etherial blue glow that emanates from it. You have never seen something like this before.

The kind Elanore has helped you get back on your feet. You told her about yourself and she really took a liking to you! She explains that she is a healer and her remedies are highly sought after by the people of Tulimshar.

You seem to have been robbed of most of your possessions, so Elanore offers to pay you to work for her for the day.

After you return with her items, Elanore explains that her healing skills are different from other physicians, as she is able to tap into the energies of the nearby Soul Menhir.

She tells you how there have been recent attacks on the city coming from twisted creatures in the desert, corrupted by Kaore: the opposite force to Mana. She explains that the influence of Kaore has been growing lately and strange things have been happening. Some people in the city are looking sickly, you may wish to check in on them and then consult with Elanore about their illness.

She then directs you to two different NPCs (you may visit them in any order):

- Apprentice Nina: Elanore's apprentice. She tells you that she is the one who found you in the desert. She seems to like you and is very concerned for your well-being. She hands you her Zielite Amulet and tells you to return it when you've settled in the city and are no longer in trouble.

She can explain more in depth topics like Mana, Kaore, Zielite, Soul Menhirs and Druids. Listening to her whole dialogue grants {exp}.

She expresses a desire for a sugary treat. You may go to the bakery to get her a croissant. {Gold, exp, karma}

- Watchman Ekiru: Ekiru warns you against going into the desert as unprepared as you were the first time around. He tells you about the troubles the local cactus farmers are having with oversized maggots and suggests that you could get some training by helping the town guard there.

In the cactus fields, Watchman Kyle provides a combat tutorial and a quest to kill maggots. {exp} You are sent back to Watchman Ekiru. You can trade 20x [Maggot Slime] with Elanore in exchange for a health potion {repeatable}.

Watchman Eriku is impressed with your work and decides to recommend you for the upcoming expedition to the Old Tulimshar Mines, located outside the city walls and deeper into the desert. You are directed into the guard's barracks where you meet Vigilant Miro, the high ranking officer who will lead the expedition. You are given a basic set of armour and a rusty axe. {Worn Armour set, Rusty Axe}
